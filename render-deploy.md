# Running Your Online Game Locally

You do NOT need any third-party services. You can run your game directly from your computer.

## Steps
1. Open a terminal in your project folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the server with `npm start` or `node server.js`.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.
5. To allow others to join, share your computer's IP address and ensure port 8080 is open (set up port forwarding if needed).

## Notes
- No third-party hosting required.
- Your game is fully self-hosted and private.
